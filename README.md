A simple python script to write a cover letter using a the information from a CV text file, a Job Description from a website and additional Notes using OpenAI API. 
You have to add your OpenAI API Key to your development system to use the OpenAI Library, for example: export OPENAI_API_KEY=blablablakeyblablabla

I wrote this script mainly to improve my cover letter style in different languages. I usually heavily edit the result.
It also helps me to see how much my CV actually matches the job description.
GPT has a knack to see value in all my endeavors. For example my experience with a homeless non-profit organization counts as client communication experience.

I haven't been able to land a job with this script. Just so you know...
